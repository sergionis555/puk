## Installation & Usage:

- Clone this repository.
- Set up a new Telegram bot talking to the `BotFather`.
- Copy this token and replace it in the beginning of the script.
- Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Install pyHook `64-bit` or `32-bit` depending on your system.
    - For 64-bit- `pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl`.
    - For 32-bit- `pip install pyHook-1.5.1-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl`.
- To run the script: `python RATAttack.py`.
- Find your bot on telegram and send some command to the bot to test it.
- To restrict the bot so that it responds only to you, note down your `chat_id` from the console and replace it in the script and comment out the line `return True`. Don't worry, you'll know when you read the comments in the script.
